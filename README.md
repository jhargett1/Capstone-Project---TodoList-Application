# ToDoList-EJS-Node

The goal of this project was to create a ToDo List web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application allows users to create and view tasks. Tasks will not persist between sessions as no database is used in this version of the application. 

## Technical Requirements

1. Node.js & Express.js: The application is a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js handles routing and middleware.

2. EJS: EJS is used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
